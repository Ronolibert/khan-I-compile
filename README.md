# Khan I Compile

## What is it?
Khan I Compile is a text editor where you can give restrictions, requirements, and a template for the code inside of the text editor to determine if the code meets certain criteria.


## Get Started
To get started, download the repository. Once inside of the directory, run ```npm start ``` to get started.

## Requirements
Requirements lets you check certain configurations and you are required to use a valid statement of that type to "pass"

## Restrictions
Restrictions lets you limit what code you can write, if you write a valid statement of that type the app does not pass

## Template
Template lets you give a template to follow for yourself. An example template would be
```
for (_;_;_) {
  if (_) {
    console.log('is this right?');
  }
}
```
This template says to use a for loop with an if statement inside of it, the values do not matter as long as it is a valid construct
